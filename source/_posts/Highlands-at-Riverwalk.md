<p class="lead">Nestled along the Milwaukee River near the heart of City of Mequon, the Highlands at Riverwalk is an Active Senior Living Apartment Community that balances private north shore living with convenient access to area amenities. Trio led planning efforts to define a building and site footprint that blended into this siteâ€™s wooded environment, and provided all civil engineering and land surveying services needed to help bring it to fruition.</p>

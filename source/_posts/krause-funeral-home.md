<p class="lead">Trio worked in partnership with the architect and Krause family to develop a new facility that stands as an aesthetically pleasing gateway to the west side of the City of Brookfield. The building was expertly fit into the topography of the site to provide the exposures desired for the facility, creating a private setting for patrons while providing prominent visibility to the neighboring state highway. The site plan integrated with various site constraints to achieve a unique and efficient layout, and uses stormwater ponds and open space as visual amenities for the facility.</p>

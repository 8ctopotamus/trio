<p class="lead">CELA is a Christian based 4k â€“ 8th grade academy that stands apart from all others, integrating an exceptional education with a state of the art campus. Trio worked with the owners, construction manager, architect and design team to help bring the CELA dream to life, providing layout and civil design for the expansive site improvements. The 55 acre campus includes the 170,000 s.f. educational academy, outdoor play areas including tennis courts, basketball courts, artificial turf soccer and baseball fields, and a flowing parking setup with efficient drop-off circulation.  Stormwater is managed through sustainable bioswales and infiltration basins strategically placed around the site. </p>

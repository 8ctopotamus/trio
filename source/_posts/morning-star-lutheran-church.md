<p class="lead">Morning Star is a growing church community where “serious” and “casual” walk hand in hand. Trio was part of the team that helped the church take a vision and turn it into reality, developing a new church with supporting parking, site and open space improvements.  Enhancing the atmosphere of the church, Trio’s approach to stormwater management employed biofiltration, rain gardens and sustainable stormwater solutions.</p>

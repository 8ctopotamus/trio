<p class="lead">A mixed use community in the heart of Wales comprised of 99 apartments within six centrally located buildings, a clubhouse, and 15 single family residential homes.  Trio was active in the design of this development, creating a site that embodies the characteristics of the Village â€“ undulating slopes, fields and stands of trees intermixed with the development footprint. The project places an emphasis on walkability, including a link to the Glacial Drumlin State Trail and an internal sidewalk network. The stormwater approach focuses on infiltration to support sustained function of the surrounding kettle watershed.</p>
